Remove remaining txcorp-specific references to or in sphinx

All package files for our proprietary applications and for
the corresponding tests for our proprietary applications
should be moved to txcbilder.  At least vorpal, nautilus,
polyswift, all composers.

All machine files for our machines should be moved to
txcbilder.

Remove the chrpath command from python

Remove fixdarwinnames.sh

Remove fixDarwinObj from bildfcns.sh

Remove the addition of XORIGIN to the link lines at our
package level.  This should be done by txcbilder, or there
should be an additional ld variable added..

(We may need to define a per-package hook to get this done.)

Remove this file.

grep for txcorp in bilder after doing the above, and make
sure that it does not appear.

grep txcbilder in bilder and make sure that it does not appear.
