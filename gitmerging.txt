MERGING FROM A REMOTE REPO

NOTE: When working with github, one must have git-1.7.10 or later.

  $Id$

Make sure you have a remote to what you want to merge from using

  git remote -v

If not, add one, e.g.,

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/svalinn/DAGMC.git

This is the PKG_UPSTREAM_URL in the pkg_aux.sh file.

Set the working branch:

  wbranch=(develop | master)

Make sure you are on the right branch

  git checkout $wbranch

If you do not yet have it, fetch the branch you want to merge

  git fetch upstream $wbranch:upstream-$wbranch
  git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/$wbranch upstream-$wbranch

If you already have it, switch to it and pull

  git checkout upstream-$wbranch
  git pull

Move back to develop branch

  git checkout $wbranch

Now merge that in.

  git merge upstream-$wbranch

Commit and push:

  git commit -am "MSG"
  git push
