MERGING FROM A REMOTE REPO

NOTE: When working with github, one must have git-1.7.10 or later.

Make sure you have a remote to what you want to merge from using

  git remote -v

If not, add one, e.g.,

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/svalinn/DAGMC.git

Make sure you are on the right branch

  git checkout develop

If you do not yet have it, fetch the branch you want to merge

  git fetch upstream develop:upstream-develop
  git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/develop upstream-develop

If you already have it, switch to it and pull

  git checkout upstream-develop
  git pull

Move back to develop branch

  git checkout develop

Now merge that in.

  git merge upstream-develop

Commit and push:

  git commit -am "MSG"
  git push
